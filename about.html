  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an engineering student at ENSAK with a keen passion for robotics, coding, and cybersecurity, alongside a broad interest in computer systems and networks. Through my academic journey, I have gained practical experience in programming microcontrollers like Arduino, designing mechanical parts with CATIA V5, and participating in robotics competitions such as RobotCAD and Smart Lavage. I am skilled in various programming languages and software tools and have developed a strong analytical mindset, creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. Beyond academics, I am deeply committed to humanitarian causes, having actively contributed to the 7th edition of the Al Amal Humanitarian Caravan organized by Club Anaruz, as well as other community outreach initiatives. I thrive in team environments and enjoy applying my knowledge to real-world challenges, constantly seeking growth both as a technologist and a socially responsible individual.</p>
